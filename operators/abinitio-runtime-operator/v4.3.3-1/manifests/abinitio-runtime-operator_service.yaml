# Headless service for the operator deployment/stateful set.
# Note: we want the service to be named the same as the operator's deployment.
# This is needed for the stateful set anyway, because each individual pod gets
# its own service based on the common one. However, we will preserve the
# historical service name for backward compatibility, if the service with
# that name already exists and sharding is not used, i.e. the operator is being
# upgraded as a deployment, not as a stateful set.

          CommonService is the Schema for the commonservices API. This API is used to
          configure general foundational services configurations, such as sizing,
          catalogsource, etc. See description of fields for more details. An instance
          of this CRD is automatically created by the ibm-common-service-operator upon
          installation to trigger the installation of critical installer components
          such as operand-deployment-lifecycle-manager (ODLM), which is required to
          further install other services from foundational services, such as IM.

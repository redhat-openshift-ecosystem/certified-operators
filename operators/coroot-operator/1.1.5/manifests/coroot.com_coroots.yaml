                                    incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                    to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                    for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                    pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                    The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                    Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                    This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

                              Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%).
                              This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                              Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1.
                              Default value is 0.
                              Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes
                              that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled)
                              can have their a new pod created before the old pod is marked as deleted.
                              The update starts by launching new pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated
                              pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod
                              on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any
                              reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated
                              pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge limits.
                              Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
                              daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and
                              so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may
                              cause evictions during disruption.

                              the update.

                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

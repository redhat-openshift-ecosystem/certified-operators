          The CouchbaseScopeMigration resource represents the use of the special migration mapping
          within XDCR to take a filtered list from the default scope and collection of the source bucket,
          replicate it to named scopes and collections within the target bucket.
          The bucket-to-bucket replication cannot duplicate any used by the CouchbaseReplication resource,
          as these two types of replication are mutually exclusive between buckets.

                description: |-
                  FilterBinary specifies whether binary documents should be replicated.
                  The value can be true or false (the default). If the value is true, binary documents are not replicated, regardless of whether a filterExpression is applied. If the value is false:
                  The behavior is identical to that of all Couchbase-Server versions prior to 7.2.1 (with the exception of 7.1.5), where the filterBinary flag did not exist.
                  If a filter expression is not provided, binary documents are replicated.
                  If a filter expression is provided, and the expression refers only to either the document's key, or its xattr, or to both, the expression is applied, and the document is replicated if the expression permits.
                  If a filter expression is provided, and the expression refers only to the document's body, the document is replicated.
                  If a filter expression is provided, and the expression refers to the document's key, or its xattr, or to both; and also refers to the document's body; the document is not replicated (regardless of whether the key or xattr might appear to permit replication).

                  When false (default), replication restarts after filter changes. When true, continues without restart.
                  Note: Server requires this field when filterExpression is set. If not specified, operator defaults to false.

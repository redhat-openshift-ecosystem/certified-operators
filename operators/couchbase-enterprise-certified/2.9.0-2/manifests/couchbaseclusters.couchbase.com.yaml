                  failure in the event of a node issue.  Use of anti-affinity is highly recommended for
                  production clusters.

                  AutoResourceAllocation populates pod resource requests based on the services running

                  by `spec.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent`.Changing individual allocations for
                  a service will cause a cluster upgrade as allocations are modified in the underlying
                  pods.  This field also allows default pod CPU requests and limits to be applied.
                  All resource allocations can be overridden by explicitly configuring them in the
                  `spec.servers.resources` field.

                  AutoscaleStabilizationPeriod defines how long after a rebalance the
                  corresponding HorizontalPodAutoscaler should remain in maintenance mode.
                  During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscaler
                  associated with the cluster becomes inactive.
                  Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading,
                  setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from the
                  HorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.

                  Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher:
                  https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration
                  A value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance but
                  immediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed.
                  When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance.

                      Synchronize allows unmanaged buckets, scopes, and collections to be synchronized as

                      and should not be used for production workloads.  The synchronization workflow starts
                      with `spec.buckets.managed` being set to false, the user can manually create buckets,
                      scopes, and collections using the Couchbase UI, or other tooling.  When you wish to
                      commit to Kubernetes resources, you must specify a unique label selector in the
                      `spec.buckets.selector` field, and this field is set to true.  The Operator will
                      create Kubernetes resources for you, and upon completion set the cluster's `Synchronized`
                      status condition. Synchronizing will not create a Kubernetes resource for the Couchbase
                      Server maintained _system scope. You may then safely set `spec.buckets.managed` to
                      true and the Operator will manage these resources as per usual.  To update an already
                      managed data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and delete
                      any old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operator
                      can not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specifications
                      that are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool. These
                      actions must be instigated by an end user.  For a more complete experience, refer to

                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of

                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                                  The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                                  The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for

                                  Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                                  through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                                  "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                  to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                  specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                  EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                  allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                  than a virtual IP.
                                  "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                  routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                  "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                  (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                  as the clusterIP.
                                  "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                  Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                  meaning only a single Couchbase node can be voluntarily disrupted at a time. When this field is set to true, a PDB will be created for each
                  service class, with a minAvailable value of one less than the service class size. This allows for a more granular
                  control over the number of Couchbase nodes that can be voluntarily disrupted at a time, such as during a Kubernetes upgrade.
                  In order to enable this feature, the size of each service class must be at least 2 and the maximum number of Couchbase nodes
                  that the PDB's would allow to be disrupted at once cannot exceed 50% of the total number of Couchbase nodes requested in the cluster specification.
                  Furthermore, the requested number of replicas for both the index and data services must remain less than the minimum number
                  of Couchbase nodes that the server class PDB's will cumulatively allow for.

                  This may cause data loss, and is only expected to be used on clusters with ephemeral

                  aware scheduling when none is provided for you.  Global server groups are

                  basis to give more control over scheduling and server groups.

                        version. Across spec.image and all server classes there can only be two
                        different Couchbase images. Updating this field to a value different than
                        spec.image will cause an automatic upgrade of the server class. If it isn't
                        specified then the cluster image will be used.

                                      MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                      spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                      incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                      to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                      for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                      MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                      Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                      be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                      MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                      between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                      The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                      or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                      In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                      - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                      scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                      violate MaxSkew(1).
                                      - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                      When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                      to topologies that satisfy it.

                                      MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                      When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                      Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                      And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                      this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                      As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                      scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                      If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                      Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                      When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                      For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                      labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                      | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                      |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                      The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                      In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew.

                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                            dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                            volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                            core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                            the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                            provisioner.
                            This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                            if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                            compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                            both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                            value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                            When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                            dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                            There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                            * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                              specified.
                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                              in any namespaces.
                            (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

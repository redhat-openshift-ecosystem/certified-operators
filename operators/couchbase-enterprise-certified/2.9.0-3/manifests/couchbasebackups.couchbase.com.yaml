                  AutoScaling allows the volume size to be dynamically increased.
                  When specified, the backup volume will start with an initial size
                  as defined by `spec.size`, and increase as required.

                      ThresholdPercent determines the point at which a volume is autoscaled.
                      This represents the percentage of free space remaining on the volume,
                      when less than this threshold, it will trigger a volume expansion.
                      For example, if the volume is 100Gi, and the threshold 20%, then a resize
                      will be triggered when the used capacity exceeds 80Gi, and free space is
                      less than 20Gi.  This field defaults to 20 if not specified.

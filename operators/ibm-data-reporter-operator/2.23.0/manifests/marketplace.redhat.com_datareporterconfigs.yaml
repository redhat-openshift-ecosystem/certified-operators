                    Condition represents an observation of an object's state. Conditions are an
                    extension mechanism intended to be used when the details of an observation
                    are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind.

                    Conditions should be added to explicitly convey properties that users and
                    components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                    from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
                    changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
                    backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.

                        example, if the condition indicates when a policy is invalid, the "is valid"
                        case is probably the norm, so the condition should be called "Invalid".

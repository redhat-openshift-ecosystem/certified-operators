          IBM License Service Reporter is a singleton which may be used in a single or multi-cluster environment. It aggregates data pushed from IBM License Services, deployed on clusters and from ILMT.


          Documentation: https://ibm.biz/lsvc-rprtr.


          License: Please refer to the IBM Terms website (ibm.biz/lsvc-lic) to find the license terms for the particular IBM product for which you are deploying this component.


          IBM License Service Reporter is a free, optionally installed add-on â€“ one of services of Cloud Pak Foundational Services. Thanks to the IBM License Service Reporter customer can:


          - see IBM software deployments on a single dashboard, verify and maintain license compliance and avoid audit infractions,


          - see historical data on IBM software deployments to support making informed decisions for future purchases,


          - see details of software deployments, including source (ILMT for VMs, License Service for containers), cluster and quantities of licenses deployed,


          - identify which software deployments are VMs vs. containers and can use this information to evaluate workloads for modernization.

                        nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it cannot be
                        scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods.
                        This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide
                        to place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to
                        give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
                        As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is
                        scheduled.

                        The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
                        The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
                        arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
                        There are five possible phase values:


                        Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
                        container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
                        well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                        Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                        At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
                        Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                        Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
                        terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                        by the system.
                        Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
                        error in communicating with the host of the pod.

                        nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it cannot be
                        scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods.
                        This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide
                        to place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to
                        give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
                        As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is
                        scheduled.

                        The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle.
                        The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status
                        arrays contain more detail about the pod's status.
                        There are five possible phase values:


                        Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the
                        container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as
                        well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while.
                        Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created.
                        At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
                        Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
                        Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
                        terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated
                        by the system.
                        Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an
                        error in communicating with the host of the pod.

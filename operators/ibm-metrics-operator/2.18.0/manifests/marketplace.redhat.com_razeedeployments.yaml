                    Condition represents an observation of an object's state. Conditions are an

                    are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind.


                    Conditions should be added to explicitly convey properties that users and
                    components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                    from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
                    changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
                    backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.

                      FailedIndexes holds the failed indexes when spec.backoffLimitPerIndex is set.
                      The indexes are represented in the text format analogous as for the
                      `completedIndexes` field, ie. they are kept as decimal integers
                      separated by commas. The numbers are listed in increasing order. Three or
                      more consecutive numbers are compressed and represented by the first and
                      last element of the series, separated by a hyphen.
                      For example, if the failed indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are
                      represented as "1,3-5,7".
                      The set of failed indexes cannot overlap with the set of completed indexes.


                      This field is beta-level. It can be used when the `JobBackoffLimitPerIndex`
                      feature gate is enabled (enabled by default).

                      first time it is resumed. This field is reset every time a Job is resumed
                      from suspension. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.


                      Once set, the field can only be removed when the job is suspended.
                      The field cannot be modified while the job is unsuspended or finished.

                      This field is beta-level. The job controller populates the field when

                      the job controller hasn't yet accounted for in the status counters.


                      The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates
                      (succeeded or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it
                      in the job status:


                      1. Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field.
                      2. Remove the pod finalizer.
                      3. Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the corresponding
                          counter.


                      Old jobs might not be tracked using this field, in which case the field
                      remains null.

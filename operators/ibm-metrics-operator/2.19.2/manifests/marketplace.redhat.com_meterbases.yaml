                    backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.

                        Condition represents an observation of an object's state. Conditions are an
                        extension mechanism intended to be used when the details of an observation
                        are not a priori known or would not apply to all instances of a given Kind.

                        Conditions should be added to explicitly convey properties that users and
                        components care about rather than requiring those properties to be inferred
                        from other observations. Once defined, the meaning of a Condition can not be
                        changed arbitrarily - it becomes part of the API, and has the same
                        backwards- and forwards-compatibility concerns of any other part of the API.

                            Condition types should indicate state in the "abnormal-true" polarity. For
                            example, if the condition indicates when a policy is invalid, the "is valid"
                            case is probably the norm, so the condition should be called "Invalid".

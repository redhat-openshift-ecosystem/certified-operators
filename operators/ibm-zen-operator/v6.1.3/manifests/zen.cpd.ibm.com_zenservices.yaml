                * storageClass: if storageVendor is not set, then identify a File storage class that supports RWX access mode as the default class
                * zenCoreMetaDbStorageClass: overrides the default storageClass value specified. Highly recommended that a Block storage class be specified for reliability
                * storageVendor: predefined storage name, one of ocs|portwrox
                * acceptRollback: must be set to True explicitly to start a rollback, and set to False/No after rollback is finished
                * cloudpakfordata: (internal)set to True to install CP4D role, used only by the Cloud Pak for Data Platform Operator
                * iamIntegration: must be set to True to integrate with bedrock iam service
                * zenCustomRoute: customized/external zen route, following subkey supported
                    route_host: subkey for the customized/external zen hostname
                * scaleConfig: T-Shirt size for zen deployments, one of small, medium and large. Default is small
                * version: select a supported version to pin the zen deployments to. The default is to pick the latest, which is highly recommended.
                * zen_vault_enabled: must be set to True to enable support for external Vaults and introduce associated permissions
                * ignoreForMaintenance: set to True to temporarily pause the Zen operator's reconcile loop for maintenance.
                  For example, during quiesced backups or during upgrade or as recommended by IBM support
                * enableTopologyZone: must be set to True to enable multi-zone key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
                * enableTopologyRegion: must be set to True to enable multi-region key: topology.kubernetes.io/region
                * customizedTopologyKey: specify the custom topology key if this value has been changed in the cluster
                * nodeTaints: identify a node selector to set node tolerations for optionally isolating specific Zen pods
                  that require kubernetes RBAC to dedicated "controller" nodes. For example nodeTaints: "onlyfor=cpd-controllers:NoExecute"

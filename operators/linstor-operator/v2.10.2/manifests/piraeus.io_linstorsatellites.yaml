                  A LinstorSatellite may be deleted because:
                  * It no longer matches the affinity and node selector of the LinstorCluster resource.
                  * The node it references has been removed from Kubernetes.
                  * It was manually deleted outside the Operator.

                  A LinstorSatellite may store the last copy of a volume, in which case it is not desirable to unconditionally remove
                  the satellite from the cluster. For this reason, the following deletion policies exist:

                  * DeletionPolicyEvacuate will start evacuation of the LINSTOR Satellite and wait until it completes before removing the LinstorSatellite object, comparable to the "linstor node evacuate" command.
                  * DeletionPolicyRetain will retain the LINSTOR Satellite, keeping it registered in LINSTOR, but removing associated Kubernetes resources.
                  * DeletionPolicyDelete will remove the LINSTOR Satellite from the LINSTOR Cluster without prior eviction, comparable to the "linstor node lost" command.

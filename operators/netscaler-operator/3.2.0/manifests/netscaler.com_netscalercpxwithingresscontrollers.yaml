                            If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                            recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                            field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                            supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                            an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                            If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                      description: |-
                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                        Use this if:
                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                        of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                        more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath).
                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                            Behaves in the same way as pod.spec.containers[*].image.
                            Pull secrets will be assembled in the same way as for the container image by looking up node credentials, SA image pull secrets, and pod spec image pull secrets.

                              externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they

                              ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                              Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                              propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.
                              "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                              Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                          Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                          The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                          a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                          Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                          If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                          value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                          Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                          the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                          This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                          Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

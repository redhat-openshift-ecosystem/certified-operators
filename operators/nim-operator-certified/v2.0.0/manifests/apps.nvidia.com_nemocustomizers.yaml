                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                            "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                            Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                            exists or not.

                                    be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the

                                MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                This is a beta field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate (enabled by default).

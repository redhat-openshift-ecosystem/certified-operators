                              ingressClassName is the name of an IngressClass cluster resource. Ingress
                              controller implementations use this field to know whether they should be
                              serving this Ingress resource, by a transitive connection
                              (controller -> IngressClass -> Ingress resource). Although the
                              `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation (simple constant name) was never
                              formally defined, it was widely supported by Ingress controllers to create
                              a direct binding between Ingress controller and Ingress resources. Newly
                              created Ingress resources should prefer using the field. However, even
                              though the annotation is officially deprecated, for backwards compatibility
                              reasons, ingress controllers should still honor that annotation if present.

                                resource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified in
                                requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing each pod in the
                                current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are built in to
                                Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available
                                to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                              field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                              to \"None\" makes a \"headless service\" (no virtual
                              IP), which is useful when direct endpoint connections
                              are preferred and proxying is not required.  Only applies
                              to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this

                              creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating
                              a Service to type ExternalName.  If this field is not
                              specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP
                              field.  If this field is specified, clients must ensure
                              that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same value.
                              \n This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack
                              IPs, in either order). These IPs must correspond to
                              the values of the ipFamilies field. Both clusterIPs
                              and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.

                              the service traffic between nodes, and so each node

                              the service traffic between nodes, and so each node

                              the service traffic between nodes, and so each node
                              will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints
                              of the service, without masquerading the client source

                              Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer

                              the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and
                              allocates a port on every node which routes to the same
                              endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on

                              in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints

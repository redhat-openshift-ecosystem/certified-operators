                                            the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will

                                            within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                            a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                                            type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                            options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                            than a virtual IP.
                                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                            as the clusterIP.
                                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                may change the order over time.

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.

                            for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                            description: |-
                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.

                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              e.g. "internal-vip" or "example.com/internal-vip". Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.
                              This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load
                              balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration,
                              but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer
                              implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer
                              implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field.
                              This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.
                              Once set, it can not be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non 'LoadBalancer' type.

                              This feature depends on whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying
                              the loadBalancerIP when a load balancer is created.
                              This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not support the feature.

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              externalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they

                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to

                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                              options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                              The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                              propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                              The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                              Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                              Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                              through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                                            the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will

                                            within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                            a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account

                                            type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                                            options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                                            "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                            to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                                            specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                                            EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                                            allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                                            than a virtual IP.
                                            "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                                            routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                                            "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                            (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                            as the clusterIP.
                                            "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                                            Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

                                may change the order over time.

                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.

                                  A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that

                            to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                            for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                            MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                            Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will

                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            has a toleration, are included.

                            We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket.
                            We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                            Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                            nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                            e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                            And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                            A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

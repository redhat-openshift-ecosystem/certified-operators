                      See documentation @ https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/ including specific example for your provider.

                      Note that like the official `docker.io/dexidp/dex` image,
                      `gomplate` runs on the config file before dex is started.
                      It means that complex config can be achived using file/env/data urls. See docs @ https://docs.gomplate.ca/config/

      Raftt's Sandcastle is an environment controller that deploys and manages workloads.

      This role will be used by the sandcastle pod to deploy workloads in the namespace.
      It will be used with a RoleBinding so namspaced objects will apply only for its own namespace.
      cluster wide resources will still work.

      If you are experiencing permission issues when deploying resources,
      create a new ClusterRole with the label `rbac.raftt.io/sandcastle: 'true'`
      with any additional permissions needed.

      Security notes
      ---------------
      * monitor usage of this cluster role with rolebindings (only `raftt-sandcastle` in `raftt-` namespaces)
      * monitor usage of this cluster role with clusterrolebinding (never happens)
      * use webhook authorization solution to enforce the above
      * monitor creation of new cluster roles that contains the aggregation label

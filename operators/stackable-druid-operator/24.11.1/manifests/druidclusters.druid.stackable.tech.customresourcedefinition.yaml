                description: This struct represents a role - e.g. HDFS datanodes or
                  Trino workers. It has a key-value-map containing all the roleGroups
                  that are part of this role. Additionally, there is a `config`, which
                  is configurable at the role *and* roleGroup level. Everything at
                  roleGroup level is merged on top of what is configured on role level.
                  There is also a second form of config, which can only be configured
                  at role level, the `roleConfig`. You can learn more about this in
                  the [Roles and role group concept documentation](https://docs.stackable.tech/home/24.11/concepts/roles-and-role-groups).

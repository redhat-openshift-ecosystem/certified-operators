                                      \ will be put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                      \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or\
                                      \ down (with a corresponding increase or decrease\
                                      \ in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision\
                                      \ is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted\
                                      \ - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as\
                                      \ possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless\
                                      \ the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n-\
                                      \ 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi\
                                      \ will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that\
                                      \ the quantity will NEVER be internally represented\
                                      \ by a floating point number. That is the whole\
                                      \ point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                      \ will still parse as long as they are well\
                                      \ formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical\
                                      \ form. (So always use canonical form, or don't\
                                      \ diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make\
                                      \ it difficult to use these numbers without\
                                      \ writing some sort of special handling code\
                                      \ in the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                      \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

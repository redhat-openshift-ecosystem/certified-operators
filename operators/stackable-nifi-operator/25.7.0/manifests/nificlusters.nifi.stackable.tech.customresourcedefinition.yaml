                                      \ it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity\
                                      \ will be put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                      \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or\
                                      \ down (with a corresponding increase or decrease\
                                      \ in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision\
                                      \ is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted\
                                      \ - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as\
                                      \ possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless\
                                      \ the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n-\
                                      \ 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi\
                                      \ will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that\
                                      \ the quantity will NEVER be internally represented\
                                      \ by a floating point number. That is the whole\
                                      \ point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                      \ will still parse as long as they are well\
                                      \ formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical\
                                      \ form. (So always use canonical form, or don't\
                                      \ diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make\
                                      \ it difficult to use these numbers without\

                                      \ is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted\
                                      \ - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as\
                                      \ possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless\
                                      \ the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n-\
                                      \ 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi\
                                      \ will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that\
                                      \ the quantity will NEVER be internally represented\
                                      \ by a floating point number. That is the whole\
                                      \ point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                      \ will still parse as long as they are well\
                                      \ formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical\
                                      \ form. (So always use canonical form, or don't\
                                      \ diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make\
                                      \ it difficult to use these numbers without\
                                      \ writing some sort of special handling code\

                                      \ will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m\
                                      \ will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended\

                                      \ a string, it will remember the type of suffix\
                                      \ it had, and will use the same type again when\
                                      \ it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity\
                                      \ will be put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                      \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or\
                                      \ down (with a corresponding increase or decrease\
                                      \ in Mantissa) such that:\n\n- No precision\
                                      \ is lost - No fractional digits will be emitted\
                                      \ - The exponent (or suffix) is as large as\
                                      \ possible.\n\nThe sign will be omitted unless\
                                      \ the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n-\
                                      \ 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\" - 1.5Gi\
                                      \ will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that\
                                      \ the quantity will NEVER be internally represented\
                                      \ by a floating point number. That is the whole\
                                      \ point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                      \ will still parse as long as they are well\
                                      \ formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical\
                                      \ form. (So always use canonical form, or don't\
                                      \ diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make\
                                      \ it difficult to use these numbers without\
                                      \ writing some sort of special handling code\
                                      \ in the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                      \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

                                            \ type of suffix it had, and will use\
                                            \ the same type again when it is serialized.\n\
                                            \nBefore serializing, Quantity will be\

                                            \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                            \ up or down (with a corresponding increase\
                                            \ or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\
                                            \n- No precision is lost - No fractional\
                                            \ digits will be emitted - The exponent\
                                            \ (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\
                                            \nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                            \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n\
                                            - 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\
                                            \ - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\
                                            \n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER\
                                            \ be internally represented by a floating\
                                            \ point number. That is the whole point\
                                            \ of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                            \ will still parse as long as they are\
                                            \ well formed, but will be re-emitted\
                                            \ in their canonical form. (So always\
                                            \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\
                                            \nThis format is intended to make it difficult\
                                            \ to use these numbers without writing\
                                            \ some sort of special handling code in\
                                            \ the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                            \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

                                            \ from a string, it will remember the\
                                            \ type of suffix it had, and will use\
                                            \ the same type again when it is serialized.\n\
                                            \nBefore serializing, Quantity will be\
                                            \ put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                            \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                            \ up or down (with a corresponding increase\
                                            \ or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\
                                            \n- No precision is lost - No fractional\
                                            \ digits will be emitted - The exponent\
                                            \ (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\
                                            \nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                            \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n\
                                            - 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\
                                            \ - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\
                                            \n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER\
                                            \ be internally represented by a floating\
                                            \ point number. That is the whole point\
                                            \ of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                            \ will still parse as long as they are\
                                            \ well formed, but will be re-emitted\
                                            \ in their canonical form. (So always\
                                            \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\
                                            \nThis format is intended to make it difficult\
                                            \ to use these numbers without writing\
                                            \ some sort of special handling code in\
                                            \ the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                            \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

                                            \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                            \ up or down (with a corresponding increase\
                                            \ or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\
                                            \n- No precision is lost - No fractional\
                                            \ digits will be emitted - The exponent\
                                            \ (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\
                                            \nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                            \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n\
                                            - 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\
                                            \ - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\
                                            \n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER\
                                            \ be internally represented by a floating\
                                            \ point number. That is the whole point\
                                            \ of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                            \ will still parse as long as they are\
                                            \ well formed, but will be re-emitted\
                                            \ in their canonical form. (So always\
                                            \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\
                                            \nThis format is intended to make it difficult\
                                            \ to use these numbers without writing\
                                            \ some sort of special handling code in\
                                            \ the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                            \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

                                            \ from a string, it will remember the\
                                            \ type of suffix it had, and will use\
                                            \ the same type again when it is serialized.\n\
                                            \nBefore serializing, Quantity will be\
                                            \ put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                            \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                            \ up or down (with a corresponding increase\
                                            \ or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\
                                            \n- No precision is lost - No fractional\
                                            \ digits will be emitted - The exponent\
                                            \ (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\
                                            \nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                            \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n\
                                            - 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\
                                            \ - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\
                                            \n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER\
                                            \ be internally represented by a floating\
                                            \ point number. That is the whole point\
                                            \ of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                            \ will still parse as long as they are\
                                            \ well formed, but will be re-emitted\
                                            \ in their canonical form. (So always\
                                            \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\
                                            \nThis format is intended to make it difficult\
                                            \ to use these numbers without writing\
                                            \ some sort of special handling code in\
                                            \ the hopes that that will cause implementors\
                                            \ to also use a fixed point implementation."

                                            \ type of suffix it had, and will use\
                                            \ the same type again when it is serialized.\n\
                                            \nBefore serializing, Quantity will be\
                                            \ put in \"canonical form\". This means\
                                            \ that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted\
                                            \ up or down (with a corresponding increase\
                                            \ or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n\
                                            \n- No precision is lost - No fractional\
                                            \ digits will be emitted - The exponent\
                                            \ (or suffix) is as large as possible.\n\
                                            \nThe sign will be omitted unless the\
                                            \ number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n\n\
                                            - 1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\
                                            \ - 1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\
                                            \n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER\
                                            \ be internally represented by a floating\
                                            \ point number. That is the whole point\
                                            \ of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values\
                                            \ will still parse as long as they are\
                                            \ well formed, but will be re-emitted\
                                            \ in their canonical form. (So always\
                                            \ use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\

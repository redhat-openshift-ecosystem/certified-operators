  displayName: Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper
  description: |-
    This is a Kubernetes operator to manage [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) ensembles. The Stackable Apache ZooKeeper Operator
    is part of the Stackable Data Platform, a curated selection of the best open source data apps like Kafka, Druid, Trino or Spark, all
    working together seamlessly. Based on Kubernetes, it runs everywhere â€“ on prem or in the cloud.

    You can install the operator using [stackablectl or helm](https://docs.stackable.tech/zookeeper/stable/getting_started/installation.html).
    See it in action in one of our [demos](https://stackable.tech/en/demos/) or follow this
    [tutorial](https://docs.stackable.tech/zookeeper/stable/getting_started/first_steps.html).

    N.B. this operator requires the following Stackable internal operators to be installed as well:

    - [Commons Operator](https://github.com/stackabletech/commons-operator)
    - [Secret Operator](https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator)

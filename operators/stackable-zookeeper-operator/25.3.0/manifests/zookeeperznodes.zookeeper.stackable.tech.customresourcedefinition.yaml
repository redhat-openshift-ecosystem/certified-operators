              A ConfigMap will automatically be created with the same name, containing
              the connection string in the field `ZOOKEEPER`. Each ZookeeperZnode
              gets an isolated ZNode chroot, which the `ZOOKEEPER` automatically contains.
              All data inside of this chroot will be deleted when the corresponding
              `ZookeeperZnode` is.


              `ZookeeperZnode` is *not* designed to manage the contents of this ZNode.
              Instead, it should be used to create a chroot for an installation of
              an application to work inside. Initializing the contents is the responsibility
              of the application.

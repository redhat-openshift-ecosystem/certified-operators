                    description: 'ServiceType the service type of the unitset type
                      determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP.
                      Valid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                      to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if
                      that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints
                      object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no
                      virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a
                      set of endpoints rather than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds
                      on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes
                      to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds
                      on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported
                      in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as
                      the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified
                      externalName. Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName
                      services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types'
